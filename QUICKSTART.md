# Quick Start Guide

## Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the plugin:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Copy to your Obsidian vault:**
   - Copy the entire `health-log-plugin` folder to `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/`
   - Make sure these files are present:
     - manifest.json
     - main.js (generated by build)
     - styles.css

4. **Enable in Obsidian:**
   - Open Obsidian
   - Go to Settings → Community Plugins
   - Turn off "Restricted mode" if needed
   - Find "Health Log Analyzer" and enable it

## First Time Setup

1. **Configure the plugin:**
   - Go to Settings → Health Log Analyzer
   - Choose detection method:
     - **Date regex**: If your daily notes are named like `2025-10-24.md`
     - **Tag**: If your daily notes have a specific tag like `#daily`

2. **Create your first health log:**
   - Open today's daily note (or create one)
   - Add a "Health log" heading
   - Add your data:
     ```markdown
     ## Health log

     Foods:
     - Coffee
     - Eggs and toast
     - Chicken salad

     Behaviors:
     - Exercised 20 minutes
     - Good sleep (8 hours)

     Symptoms:
     - None today!
     ```

3. **Run the analysis:**
   - Click the activity icon in the left sidebar, or
   - Press Cmd/Ctrl + P and type "Analyze health logs"

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Log consistently** - Add health logs to your daily notes every day
2. **Use the same format** - Stick to one format across all notes
3. **Be specific** - "Headache at 3pm, lasted 2 hours" is better than "headache"
4. **Track 7+ days** - You need multiple entries to see meaningful associations
5. **Log good days too** - Noting when you DON'T have symptoms is important

## Example Daily Note Structure

See `example-daily-note.md` in this folder for a complete example.

## Development Mode

To work on the plugin:

```bash
# Start watch mode
npm run dev
```

This will automatically rebuild when you make changes. Reload Obsidian (Cmd/Ctrl + R) to see changes.

## Troubleshooting

**"No daily notes found"**
- Check your detection method settings
- Verify your daily notes match the date regex or have the correct tag

**"No Health log sections found"**
- Make sure your heading is exactly "Health log" (or whatever you set in settings)
- Heading is case-insensitive but must match

**Items not categorized correctly**
- Use explicit category labels (Foods:, Behaviors:, Symptoms:)
- The auto-categorization is a fallback and may not be perfect

## Next Steps

Once you have 7-10 days of logs, the plugin will start showing interesting patterns like:
- Which foods correlate with specific symptoms
- How behaviors affect your well-being
- Trends over time

Remember: This shows correlations, not causation. Use insights as a starting point for discussions with healthcare providers.
